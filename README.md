# RTL Text for Grok - Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension that enables right-to-left (RTL) text display in Grok for languages like Persian, Arabic, and Hebrew.

## Description

This extension modifies the text rendering in Grok to support right-to-left (RTL) languages. By default, some interfaces may not properly align RTL text, making it hard to read. This extension detects RTL text and adjusts the layout to display it naturally from right to left, enhancing the experience for users of RTL languages.
